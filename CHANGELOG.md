## [Unreleased]

## [0.32.0] - 2016-10-24

### Added
- JsonEnvelope.asJsonObject() for simple conversion of the entire envelope to a JsonObject.
- EventStreamMatcher to match stream of JsonEnvelopes appended
- RestPoller. A polling REST client utility for integration tests
- Mechanism for taking snapshots of aggregates, disabled by default. To enable, add a dependency on
the `aggregate-snapshot-service` module. Requires the `aggregate-snapshot-repository-liquibase`
schema to be applied to the event store.
- JSON schema matching support in the JsonEnvelopeMatcher
- Added new module 'rest-core'
- ParameterType and ActionType for HTTP raml conversion
- Added 'rest-client-core' as a standard dependency for event-processor'
- Added 'rest-core' as a standard dependency for 'generators'
- Added 'rest-core' as a standard dependency for 'rest-adapter-core'
- Added 'rest-core' as a standard dependency for 'rest-client-generator'
- Added 'rest-core' as a standard dependency for 'rest-client-core'
- Added 'hamcrest-date' as a standard dependency for 'test-utils-core'

### Changed
- JsonEnvelopeMetadataMatcher to allow matching with JSON paths
- Deprecated PollingRestClient in favour of the new RestPoller

### Fixed
- RestProcessor now allows metadata from payload to be merged with headers instead of being
overwritten

### Removed
- 'raml-parser' as a dependency for 'rest-adapter-core'
- 'rest-adapter-core' as a dependency for 'rest-client-core'  

## [0.31.0] - 2016-10-24

- Failed release; do not use

## [0.30.0] - 2016-10-11

### Fixed
- Event buffer connection held open after exception in event listener
- RestClientProcessor tests clashing using common 8080 port
- JMS listeners for event topics did not use shared subscriptions. Fixing this allows multiple
instances to run. Each message will be consumed only once across a cluster.

### Added
- Hamcrest Matchers for asserting JsonEnvelopes contained within either Streams or Lists
- New Clock interface to replace DateTimeProvider
- EnumPicker in random generators

### Changed
- DateTimeProvider is now deprecated - use Clock instead

to the EventStream append method
- DateProvider to allow easy mocking of date creating for testing
- Random generators and TypeCheck class for type-based testing
- Metrics per action name

### Changed
- Event Store to include a 'date_created' timestamp field - added to the DB schema but not yet
